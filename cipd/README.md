# `infra/cipd`

The contents of this directory are automatically managed by the
`infra/bootstrap/install_cipd_packages.py` `DEPS` hook script.

This directory hosts CIPD-installed packages defined in the bootstrap
configuration.  It is effectively an auxiliary `depot_tools` executable space.
This directory should be added to your `$PATH` environment variable to enable
full `infra` repository functionality.
