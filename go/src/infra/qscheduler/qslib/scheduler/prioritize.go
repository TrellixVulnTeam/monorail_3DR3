//   - Quota account balances: requests are assigned a priority based on what
//     buckets their account has positive balance for.
//   - Max fanout: for any given account, if there are more than the max fanout
//     number of requests already running, requests for that account will be
//     deprioritized to the FreeBucket.
//
// Within a priority bucket, items are sorted in ascending examinedTime order.
