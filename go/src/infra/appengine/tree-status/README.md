# tree-status

Previously known as chromium-status, v8-status, infra-status, etc

Tree-Status is set up in a similar way to Sheriff-o-Matic. For now, see
Sheriff-o-Matic's README for details on how to run Tree-Status: [https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/HEAD/go/src/infra/appengine/sheriff-o-matic/README.md](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/HEAD/go/src/infra/appengine/sheriff-o-matic/README.md)
