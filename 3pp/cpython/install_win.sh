# This is full of .exe shims which don't work correctly unless you put
# python.exe on %PATH% (via a hack in pip_bootstrap.py). Currently (2018/11/12)
# we don't put python.exe on %PATH% for devs, and we don't use these shims on

# Rather than have a folder full of maybe-broken exes, we remove them here.

# However, when https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/simple_launcher/issues/4 is
# fixed, we can stop doing this (but will maybe have to tweak pip_bootstrap
# somehow to take advantage of the new syntax).
