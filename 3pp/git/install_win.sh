# 7z.exe silent extraction does not support "RunProgram" installation header,
# which specifies the script to run after extraction. If the downloaded exe
# worked, it would run the post-install script. Here we hard-code the name of
# the file to run instead of extracting it from the downloaded archive because
# we already have to know too much about it (see below), so we have to break the
# API boundary anyway.
#
# We expect exit code 1. The post-script.bat tries to delete itself in
# the end and it always causes a non-zero exit code.
#
# Note that the post-install.bat also ignores exit codes of the *.post
# scripts that it runs, which is the important part.
# This has been the case for at least 2yrs
