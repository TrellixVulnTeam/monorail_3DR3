    # in turn, will allow pip and friends to work, as long as `python.exe` is in
    # %PATH%.

    # Additional exe shims will have absolute paths; however we believe that
    # it's acceptable for developers to not relocate their python installations
    # after installing additional pip packages to them, since this is the
    # behavior of stock python. On bots we don't use these exe shims at all, so
    # it's a moot point.
    #
    # Unfortunately, this additionally only works for .exe files, not .bat
    # files, meaning that we'll need to find a way in depot_tools to get the
    # python.exe on %PATH%, instead of python.bat.
