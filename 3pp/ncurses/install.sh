# The "ncurses" package, by default, uses a fixed-path location for terminal
# information. This is not relocatable, so we need to disable it. Instead, we
# will compile ncurses with a set of hand-picked custom terminal information
# data baked in, as well as the ability to probe terminal via termcap if
# needed.
#
# To do this, we need to build in multiple stages:
# 1) Generic configure / make so that the "tic" (terminfo compiler) and
#    "toe" (table of entries) commands are built.
# 2) Use "toe" tool to dump the set of available profiles and groom it.
# 3) Build library with no database support using "tic" from (1), and
#    configure it to statically embed all of the profiles from (2).

# - They begin with a number, which is not valid in C.
# - They are flattened to a duplicate symbol as another profile. This
#   usually happens when there are "+" and "-" variants; we choose
#   "-".
# - They include quotes in the description name.
#
# None of these identified terminals are really important, so we will
# just avoid processing them.
