This script is a thin wrapper for running the 3pp recipe on swarming using
`led`.

By default this will:
  * Pull your logged-in email from `luci-auth` to derive a CIPD package
    prefix (if your email is `user@example.com`, this will try to upload
    to `experimental/user_at_example.com`)
  * Use the gerrit CL associated with this branch for pulling the 3pp package
    definitions. This means you need to `git cl upload` any changes to the 3pp
    directory in order to have this script pick them up.
  * Synthesize and launch a swarming task with led in the public
    `luci.flex.try` swarming pool. This swarming task will isolate the
    recipes.

Options:
  * Pass additional arguments to the script to pass directly to the
    recipe_engine. In particular:
      * 'to_build=["json","list","of","package","names"]' - This will allow
        you to restrict the packages that are built.
      * 'platform="linux-amd64"' - Allows you to select which CIPD platform
        you're targeting. This will also affect the os dimension selected for
        the led task. By default this will use Windows as the target os (since
        most of our devs have easy local access to Linux/Mac).

Tips:
  * If you end up uploading a bad package to your experimental prefix. You'll
    need to be a CIPD admin to delete them, but you can file a bug and ping
    iannucci@ or vadimsh@ to do this.

Notes:
  * You will need to give the
    `infra-try-builder@chops-service-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
    service account CIPD writer access to the experimental prefix that this
    script derives from your email (e.g.
    `cipd acl-edit -writer user:... experimental/user_at_example.com`)

# `led launch` knows how to calculate these, and reimplementing them would be

# then extract these back. It's gross.
