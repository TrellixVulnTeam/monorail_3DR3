## Configurations files for chrome-infra services.

This directory contains chrome-infra's configs for its own services. Most of
them are generated by [lucicfg] tool based on Starlark code. See [main.star]
for configs of production services and [dev.star] for configs of development
(aka staging) services.

After modifying any of the files, run `./main.star` (or `./dev.star`) to
regenerate the configs. Presubmit checks will also remind you to do so.

Currently active version can be checked at
