# - ARCHIVE_PATH is the path to the Python archive file.
# - CROSS_UNICODE is the Unicode setting value to configure the cross-compile
#   Python with.
# - CROSS_CONFIG_SITE is the path to the "config.site" file to use for
#   cross-compiling.
#
# This script expects to be called in a host build environment.
#
# We build both Python installations in a single script because the
# cross-compile Python requires some host Python files in order to work
# properly.

# (Cross) We preserve the host's "pybuilddir.txt" because of a bug in Python's
# cross-compile code. Currently, that file points to local (builder) versions
# of compiled Python libraries from the previous compile. During the
# cross-compile build, it will point to the cross-compile subdirectory instead.
# Then, when Python tries to actually run its own scripts, it will use the
# cross-compile directory for its PYTHONPATH instead of the builder directory
# (see Makefile).
