# This script builds OpenCV wheels.
#
# To build an OpenCV wheel, we require:
# 1) The OpenCV source code for the version being built.
# 2) A Python package description to construct the actual wheel
#    (using "opencv-python").
# 3) A "numpy" version that is compatible with the OpenCV version. These two
#    must be deployed alongside each other. Ensuring this is left to the user,
#    but we must establish this dependency during build for the build to work.
#
# This script is highly influenced by the "opencv-python" project and its
# documentation. However, since we want to build for an expanded set of
# platforms and for additional versions ("opencv-python" supports OpenCV3+
# only), and want to build without Travis CI, we perform the build here in our
# own script.
#
# To package "opencv-python" source, run:
# $ git clone https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python
# $ git -C opencv-python submodule update --init --recursive
#
# This script is specifically tuned to work on "manylinux" Intel builders. It is
# generic enough to probably work on others with minimal configs. For example,
# to build on a Mac, change:
# - PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH to point to the "python2.7" path on the build decide
#   (can be scraped from python-config --includes).
# - PYTHON_PACKAGES_PATH to point to the path that contains "libpython...a",
#   although it may not actually have to point to a valid location.
# - Make sure the builder has "cmake" installed. Dockcross images do, but some
#   Mac builders do not.
#
# Arguments:
#   <workdir>
#   <opencv_python_checkout>
#   <opencv_version>
#   <virtualenv_root>
#   <numpy_wheel_path>
