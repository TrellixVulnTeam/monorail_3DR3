  # With the current chops url schema /p/PROJECT/feature, we can't always add a
  # routing rule for each new project, because the limit of routing rule is 20.
  # https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/reference/dispatch-yaml#limits
  #
  # We have two options in the long run:
  # 1. Have one single frontend that serves all user requests, and different
  #    backend for different analysis pipelines. If the frontend changes too
  #    often due to backend upgrade, this might couple the deployment of
  #    different analysis pipelines.
  # 2. Have different frontend/backend combination, and use a different url
  #    schema /feature/project. But this is inconsistent with the existing url
  #    schema for chops, while we can decouple deployments of the different
  #    analysis pipelines.
  #
  # If a change is needed, we can add a url redirection handler in the default
  # module, and register a (old_url_regex, new_url_pattern) there.
