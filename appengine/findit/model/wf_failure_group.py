  # ndb.JsonProperty uses json.dumps() without sort_keys=True, which causes
  # dicts that are identical except for their internal key order to have
  # different JSON representations. So, for the failed_steps_and_tests JSON
  # property, a list is used instead of a dict (json.dumps() preserves the order
  # of list elements). This enables a WfFailureGroup query based on equivalent
  # failed_steps_and_tests to return all of the matching results, instead of
  # missing some results. Missing results is a possibility if
  # failed_steps_and_tests used a dict, and the keys of the original dict (that
  # went to the database) were JSONified to string in a different order than the
  # keys of the dict used in the query. For example:
  # '{"step_a": [], "step_y": []}' versus '{"step_y": [], "step_a": []}'.
