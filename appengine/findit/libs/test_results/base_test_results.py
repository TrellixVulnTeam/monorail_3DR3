      * status_group: passes/failures/skips/unknowns,
      * status: actual result status.

    Also counts number of expected and unexpected results for each test.
      All tests are expected to pass by default. However, some tests sometimes
      have different expected result(s) for some reason, for example flakiness,
      and such result statuses are usually specified in an expectation file or
      an equivalent.
      If the result status of a test run is the same as specified in the
      expectation file, it is deemed as expected; otherwise, it is deemed as
      unexpected.
      For example, if a WebKit layout test has expected result statuses
      ['PASS', 'FAIL'], then an actual run status 'FAIL' is expected,
      whereas 'TIMEOUT' is unexpected.

    Returns:
      (ClassifiedTestResults) An object with information for each test:
      * total_run: total number of runs,
      * num_expected_results: total number of runs with expected results,
      * num_unexpected_results: total number of runs with unexpected results,
      * results: classified test results in 4 groups: passes, failures, skips
        and unknowns.
