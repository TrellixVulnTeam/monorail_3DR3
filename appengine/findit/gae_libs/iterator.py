    query (ndb.Query): The query to fetch entities.
    projection (tuple or list): Operations return entities with only the
      specified properties set. For example:

      fields set. Note, query can only project indexed properties.

      False, iterate each entity.

    An exmaple is available in crash_printer/print_crash.py.
