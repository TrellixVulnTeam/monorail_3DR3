  # To detect hidden flaky tests causing test retries in the past 1 day.
  #
  # Assumptions for the hidden flakes in this query are:
  # 1. A hidden flaky test is a test passed eventually in a test step and has
  #    * At least one PASS or expected test result
  #    * At least one FAILED or unexpected test result
  #
  # 2. For disabled tests, they should not be run at all and have an empty list
  #    or just ['SKIP'] for run.actual of test-results-hrd:events.test_results
  #    https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/test-results-hrd:events.test_results
  #
  # Caveat:
  # 1. This query does NOT support projects that do not retry test failures.
  # 2. This query only supports Luci builds, because
  #    cr-buildbucket.raw.completed_builds_prod has no steps for buildbot-based
  #    builds even they are through buildbucket.
  # 3. This query does NOT support the case that the test have multiple
  #    unexpected test results without a PASS or expected one. This category
  #    is expected to be caught by the other queries.
