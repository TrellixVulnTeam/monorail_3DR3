  """An unnormalized loglinear model.

  We use this model for combining a bunch of different features in order
  to decide who to blame. In particular, the nice thing about loglinear
  models is that (a) they allow separating the amount of weight we
  give to each feature from the feature itself, and (b) they allow us
  to keep adding features at will without needing to worry about the
  fiddly details needed for it to be a probability model.

  Throughout the documentation we use the following conventional
  terminology. The independent variable (aka: the given data which
  sets up the classification problem) is called ``X``, where particular
  values for that variable called ``x``. The dependent variable (aka:
  the answers/labels returned by classification) is called ``Y``,
  where particular values for that random variable called ``y``. The
  partition function is called ``Z``. And (somewhat non-conventionally)
  we will call the log of the partition function ``zeta``.

  This class is distinct from ``LogLinearModel`` in that we do not require
  a specification of ``Y``. This class is sufficient for determining
  which ``y`` is the most likely, though it can only return a "score"
  rather than returning a probability per se.
