"""A simple in-RAM cache with distributed invalidation.

Here's how it works:
 + Each frontend or backend job has one CacheManager which
   owns a set of RamCache objects, which are basically dictionaries.
 + Each job can put objects in its own local cache, and retrieve them.
 + When an item is modified, the item at the corresponding cache key
   is invalidated, which means two things: (a) it is dropped from the
   local RAM cache, and (b) the key is written to the Invalidate table.
 + On each incoming request, the job checks the Invalidate table for
   any entries added since the last time that it checked.  If it finds
   any, it drops all RamCache entries for the corresponding key.
 + There is also a cron task that truncates old Invalidate entries
   when the table is too large.  If a frontend job sees more than the
   max Invalidate rows, it will drop everything from all caches,
   because it does not know what it missed due to truncation.
 + The special key 0 means to drop all cache entries.

This approach makes jobs use cached values that are not stale at the
time that processing of each request begins.  There is no guarantee that
an item will not be modified by some other job and that the cached entry
could become stale during the lifetime of that same request.

TODO(jrobbins): Listener hook so that client code can register its own
handler for invalidation events.  E.g., the sorting code has a cache that
is correctly invalidated on each issue change, but needs to be completely
dropped when a config is modified.

TODO(jrobbins): If this part of the system becomes a bottleneck, consider
some optimizations: (a) splitting the table into multiple tables by
kind, or (b) sharding the table by cache_key.  Or, maybe leverage memcache
to avoid even hitting the DB in the frequent case where nothing has changed.
