      Normally, if a project member may edit the labels, then he or she may also
      edit restriction labels.  That allows project committers to adjust access
      controls for the items that they are working on.  However, some project
      owners may prefer that once a restriction label is in place, only a project
      owner may remove it.

      Project workspaces are usually intended to promote collaboration among
      all project members.  However, sometimes a compartmentalized collaboration
      style is more appropriate.  For example, one company might want to work
      with several partners, but not let each partner know about the others.
      Note: In such a project, all artifacts should have restriction labels.
