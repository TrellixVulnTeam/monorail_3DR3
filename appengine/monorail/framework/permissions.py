"""Classes and functions to implement permission checking.

The main data structure is a simple map from (user role, project status,
project_access_level) to specific perms.

A perm is simply a string that indicates that the user has a given
permission.  The servlets and templates can test whether the current
user has permission to see a UI element or perform an action by
testing for the presence of the corresponding perm in the user's
permission set.

The user role is one of admin, owner, member, outsider user, or anon.
The project status is one of the project states defined in project_pb2,
or a special constant defined below.  Likewise for access level.
