# Note that we do not provide a command-line way to make the newly-uploaded
# version the default version. This is for two reasons: a) You should be using
# your browser to confirm that the new version works anyway, so just use the
# console interface to make it the default; and b) If you really want to use
# the command line you can use gae.py directly.
