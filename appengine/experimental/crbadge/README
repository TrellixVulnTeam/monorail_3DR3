This is an AppEngine app to display badges for software development achievements.

# Overview
This is split into the frontend and backend.  The backend can do all sorts
of computations, and then the data is uploaded to the appengine datastore
via a JSON endpoint.  The frontend grabs data from the datastore to
render.

# Backend
/backend/badgescripts - A collection of scripts to do various computations.

# Upload interface
/testdata/upload.py - A script to upload a json file into appengine.
/testdata/*.json - A collection of example json demonstrating the schema for uploding.

# Defining badges
Upload a json file with the following attributes:

```
[
  {
    "badge_name": "fakebadge", # Name of the badge, referenced by URL
    "level_1": 1,  # Threshold for what a lv1 badge is.  (Greater or equal)
    "level_2": 10,  # Threshold for what a lv1 badge is.  (Greater or equal)
    "level_3": 100,  # Threshold for what a lv1 badge is.  (Greater or equal)
    "show_number": false,  # If true, the level will be ignored and the value will be shown instead.
    "title": "What a badge",  # The title to display on the user page.
    "description": "This is a description",  # The long description to be displayed on the badge page.
    "icon": "/foobar"  # The icon to display on the user and badge page.
  }
]
```

# Uploading data.
All uploaded data is centered around badges.  When new data is uploaded, it
overwrites old data.  There is no programatic way to delete old data.
The format is as follows
```
[
  {
    "badge_name": "fakebadge",  # Name of the badge to uplad the data to.
    "data": [
      {
        "email": "user@somewhere.com",
        "value": 5
      },
      {
        "email": "user2@somewhere.com",
        "value": 50
      },
      {
        "email": "user3@somewhere.com",
        "value": 500
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

# Frontend
The frontend is a standard classic AppEngine app.
/app.yaml - Entry point.
/app.py - Where all the endpoints are.
/model.py - Where the datastore models are.
