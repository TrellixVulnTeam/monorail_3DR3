# Front-end development guidelines

## Browser support

We aim to support the two latest stable versions of each of the following
browsers:

- Chrome (Android (app + webview), Fuchsia, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Edge
- Firefox
- Safari (iOS, macOS)

To quickly test something on a specific browser and platform you can use
[Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/).

## Monitoring and alerting

See this doc on
[how to set up front-end monitoring and alerting](front_end_monitoring.md).
