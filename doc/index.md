# Chrome infrastructure

Chrome Infrastructure is responsible for repositories, code review, building
and testing of Chromium and related projects.

If you want to contribute to the Chromium browser, you're in the wrong
place. See http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved instead.

See targeted [user](users/index.md) or [chrome-infra developer](developers.md)
documentation.

If you cannot find what you're looking for here, take a look at our
[old wiki](http://dev.chromium.org/infra) <!-- TODO(nodir): convert old wiki
to md --> and feel free to ask questions on infra-dev@chromium.org.
