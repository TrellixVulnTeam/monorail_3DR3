infra:
  # Set of infra services used when building images from workstations.
  #
  # 'dev' is used by cloudbuildhelper tool by default (e.g. when ran manually on
  # a workstation without explicitly passing -infra flag).
  #
  # Images produced manually are tagged manually as well (i.e. the developer
  # will have to pass -tag flag to cloudbuildhelper).
  #
  # Images built using this set of services are OK for local use and for dev
  # clusters, but MUST NOT be deployed to clusters that have access to real
  # user data.
