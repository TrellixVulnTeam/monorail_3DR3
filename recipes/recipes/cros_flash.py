This recipe is used to flash a CrOS DUT on a Chromium bot.

This essentially calls out to the cros-sdk's flash tool (located at
https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/chromite/cli/flash.py).

That tool however has a dependency on the cros SDK's chroot (see
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_guide.md#Create-a-chroot
for more info). Though it's often used in CrOS development, the chroot isn't
found in Chromium development at all, and has very limited support on Chromium
bots. Consequently, this recipe will take care of setting it up prior to
flashing the DUT. The basic steps of this recipe are:

- Fetch a full ChromiumOS checkout via repo. The checkout will be placed in a
  named cache for subsequent re-use.
- Build the chroot.
- Enter the chroot and flash the device.
