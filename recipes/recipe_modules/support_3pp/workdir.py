class Workdir(object):
  """Workdir manages all the paths involved with building a package.

  All workdirs (`$WD`) are located at:

      [START_DIR]/3pp/wd/${name}/${platform}/${version}

  e.g.

      [START_DIR]/3pp/wd/python/linux-amd64/2.7.13.chromium16

  Each workdir contains the following subdirs:

      $WD/
        checkout/      # package sources
          .3pp/        # ALL package scripts copied here
        tools_prefix/  # build tools are installed
        deps_prefix/   # deps are installed
        out/           # output of the build

  The checkout/.3pp directory contains a copy of ALL the package definition
  folders and their contents for where the package was defined. e.g. if `python`
  is located at:

     some/repo/third_party_packages/python/3pp.pb

  Then WD/checkout/.3pp is a copy of:

     some/repo/third_party_packages/

  This allows packages to have common scripts, .vpython definitions, etc. which
  are shared across all package definitions in a given repo. The cost of the
  copy is relatively small.
